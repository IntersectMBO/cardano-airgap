# Contributing to the `cardano-airgap` project

The `cardano-airgap` repo development is done primarily with Nix.

The development environment can be entered with:

```bash
nix develop --no-pure-eval
```

## Roles and Responsibilities
We maintain a [CODEOWNERS file](CODEOWNERS) which provides information who
should review a contributing PR.  Note that you might need to get approvals
from all code owners (even though GitHub doesn't give a way to enforce it).

## Issues
To report bugs and feature requests, please submit an Issue.

## Pull Requests
Pull requests may be made from a fork by non-codeowners.
However, the CODEOWNERS reserve the exclusive right to decide what gets merged.
If you have a feature request, consider submitting an issue first.
